    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img id="float-pic"src="images/nathanharding.jpg">
    <p>My name is Nathan Harding and I am a first year comupter science student at URI.
    I chose to be a computer science major since it's a field that is becoming
    more and more important in our lives, meaning plenty of jobs and oppurtunities. I am also
    interested in the logic of coding, and I enjoy math.  My birthday is March 31st 2000. I'm 
    from Cranston Rhode Island and went to Cranston East High School. At Cranston East I was a
    member of math and science teams.

    I enjoy watching movies and playing video games. In particular,
    I am a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It would be difficult for me to pick a favorite,
    but my top five in no particular order would probably be Avengers 1, Avengers Infinity War, 
    Captain America, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Spiderman Homecoming. I'd probably throw Thor 
    Ragnarok and Ironman 1 somewhere in there too, it depends how I'm feeling. 
    <img id="float-pic"src="images/avengers.jpg">All of them are pretty good though. In addition, 
    I enjoy Edgar Wright movies, Tarintino movies, and many, many others. 
    My favorite games are usually open world, like fallout 4 and Skyrim, but I also like many others, like
    Portal and Bioshock.

    I also enjoy music, usually prefering stuff thats the 80s or before that. My favorite 
    band is Electric Light Orchestra. I'm the type of person to add more to make this page look fuller, but
    who also doesn't like talking about themsleves very much, so I'll stop here :).
