    <h1>Final Project</h1>
    <p>My final project is called Mandala Maker. The purpose of it is to be able to create mandalas, or complex, symmetrical geometric figures, 
    using the shapes from the Processing JS library. In addition to using these shapes, you can manipulate specific elements of the shape like color and size using the
    menu system. With theses tools, you can be pretty creative and make some pretty cool designs!
    </p>
    <p>In order to use te program, click start. At the start the shape is set to lines, or you can select what shape you want with the menu. Click once to pick te first point of your shape, then
    move the mouse around to see where the second point of your shape will be. Some shapes have 3 or 4 clicks inolved, so play around with it to see which shapes do what. In addition, you can change
    the color and width of your lines using the stroke button. You can also change the color inside shapes like circles using the fill button, and you can change the color of the background using 
    the back button. The show button can hide your menu or display a grid to help you create designs. The shape counter lets you know how many shapes you have drawn, and the undo button removes
    the most recently drawn shape. Many of the buttons also have shortcuts on the keyboard, so look at the buttons to see what those shortcuts are.
