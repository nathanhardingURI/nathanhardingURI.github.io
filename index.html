    <h1>Welcome to this Page!</h1>
    <p>My name is Nathan Harding and I am a first year computer science student at URI. The creation of this website was my first project, 
    and was updated as I completed more CS coursework. I used html to create the website and css to style it. It tracks the various elements of
    javaScript I have learned and also includes my final project. The final project was to use the Processing JS Library to develop an original concept.
    It also involved working with a partner and using the SCRUM agile software development process. Anyway, you can explore the website using the tabs above.</p>
